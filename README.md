# Purely Functional Data Structures in Scala

This is just an educational project to capture my code as I work through Chris
Okasaki's Purely Functional Data Structures, implementing parts of it in Scala
for practice and to translate it into a language I know better than ML.

These implementations aren't designed to be comprehensive and you probably
shouldn't use them directly, but feel free to use them however you see fit if
you find them useful.

I am releasing this under the MIT license, so this is purely optional, but if
you do end up using something from this project, please send me a message as I
would be curious to know how you end up using it.
